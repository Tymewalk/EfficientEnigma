# EfficientEnigma
*A Discord bot that works well, for no reason at all.*

## Setup and Installation
Step 1: Clone the repository:

    cd /path/to/where/you/want/the/files/
    git clone https://github.com/Tymewalk/EfficientEnigma/
    cd EfficientEnigma
    
Step 2: Install dependencies:

    pip3 install discord-py asyncio
    
Step 3: Set up the bot:

    python3.5 config.py

You will be prompted for your token and a couple of other options.

    python3.5 bot.py
    
It is advised to do this in a `screen` session, so you don't have a terminal sitting there open.
